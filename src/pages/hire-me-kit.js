            <p>
              Today I'm early releasing the Hire-Me Kit. A collection: email
              template, email example, and a video for interns. There will be
              updates along the way.
            </p>

            <p>
              After a big career switch from restaurant/retail to creative and
              software work, I've experienced a role. Also, I've conducted
              hundreds of interviews and hires. Over my career, I've have
              collected a fine-tuned way of getting hired.
            </p>

            <p>
              We are often aware of our wants, but rarely know what the next
              step is to getting reach those goals. When it comes to getting a
              job, our mental patterns are:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>"I'm not ready just yet."</li>
              <li>"They(company) aren't ready to hire now"</li>
              <li>"I'm not skilled enough."</li>
              <li>"That company isn't hiring."</li>
              <li>"We're in a rough economy, I'll just wait."</li>
              <li>"I don't have anything to offer that company."</li>
              <li>"I have no experience. There is no way..."</li>
              <li>"I don't have a profile of work."</li>
              <li>"Just one more can of Pringles."</li>
              <li>"I'll just send my resume and cover letter."</li>
              <li>"Just one more Netflix/Hulu/Prime episode."</li>
              <li>"The company doesn't have any jobs posted."</li>
              <li>"This video game sure is fun."</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Oh, stop it! You are great. You might need to improve. Don't we
              all. With this kit, I'll show you how you can standout with what
              you have and where you are.
            </p>

            <p>
              Please don't buy this toolkit if you are ready to back up this
              approach with some hard work. No one wants to hire a great
              interview-actor.
            </p>

            <p>
              Please purchase this toolkit if you are excited about a company or
              gig and ready to show off. {`ðŸ’ª`}
            </p>

            <p>
              It's not just a toolkit, but a mental model. ...A different way of
              thinking.
            </p>

            <p>
              For those that see a job and are ready to dive in, this toolkit is
              for you.
            </p>
