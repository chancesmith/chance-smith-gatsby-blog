You arrive at your floor in your hotel room.
You notice the table right before you right when the elevator door opens. This wooden Fourier table is practically empty, simply decorated. The surface is clear, a clean slate, and simple to appreciate.

You appreciate the design, but you also appreciate the lack of clutter and mess. This clean surface isn’t demand anything of you, or anyone.
