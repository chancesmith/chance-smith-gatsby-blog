Business development and the psychology of sales have been of interest ever since managing restaurants and retail stores. The team is counting on your to land the gigs or new customers.

This is a growing collection I need as a way to document and understand value pricing.

## Pricing Options

### Price Buyer

### The Home DepotÂ® option

Think High-margin thinking and low-margin tactics. Focus on how you engage with the customer, not how much you will do with the customer.

"All right, I've got three different ways that we can work together. I want you to choose the one based on your comfort level with risk so at the highest priced option, I have for you is an engagement or a way of working with you where we take away as much risk as possible." -- Blair Enns talking to customer

1. diagnostic "We'll tell you what needs to be done"
2. Home Depot option "You can do it. We can help." ðŸ‘ˆ values the brains and hands
3. everything "We'll do it all."

### Goldilocks

1x, 2.2x, 5x

### Might as well

1x, 1.5x, 1.75x to get the job without leaving money on the table.

### Plus 85

1x (estimated) and 1.85x (fixed) to balance the risk/reward on you or the customer. An intro into value pricing.
