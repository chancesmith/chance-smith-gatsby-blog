If you are a team of one or a team of many, here are quick tips on how to be more personal with customers.

I've mentioned [using gifs](https://blog.chancesmith.org/making-customer-service-and-email-personal/) before to be more personal and standout. I also showed [how to make gifs](https://blog.chancesmith.org/how-to-make-your-own-gifs-tldr/).

#3 Ways To Have A Personal Approach
Anyone else can do the job you do, it's the relationship that matters most.

Get personal yo!

## ## Use your face...

- in a gif #sawThatComing
- in your email signature
- in your marketing pieces
- in your video tutorials

Here is my email signature:

I know. I know. I'll make a gif email signature soon.

## ## Find ways to make it fun

The best I can do is share an example.

This week, one of our designers was traveling before the holidays to see a friend in Seattle. She was sharing her adventure with me, telling me she sat between two fairly large people on the plane. I staged a photo and replied with this:

"Caroline, was your plane ride kinda like this?"

Earlier this year she sent me a picture of some goats sitting on the hood of a vehicle, while she was in Mexico. Let's just say this chick does some traveling. #jealous

I sent this back to her:

## ## Take personal responsibility for mistakes

Own your mistakes. Workout your humility and honesty muscles. It goes a long way.

## ## Aftermath

Have any ways you keep it _really real_ with your customers?

I'm all ears. #gif
