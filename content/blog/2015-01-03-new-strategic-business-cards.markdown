So, it was time to get some new business cards. I wanted something a little fancey and different. [Moo](http://moo.com) has great quality and offers a way to have varient designs on one side.

With the option to design multiple backs, Moo gave me an oppurtunity to try new designs and be strategic.

Here they are. Well, the backs only. :)

The top card was for a developer conference I went to in Nashville, TN. I thought it was a way to give people I meet something unique and contextual to the event. Maybe they'll remember me in the future.

#Aftermath
I know the cards are not that strategic but it did give me some ideas to try in the future.
