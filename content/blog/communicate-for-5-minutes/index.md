The 5on2 is the first of three methods for frequent communication to [collaborate better](/collaborative-superpowers).

## Ask for a 5on2

A [5on2](/glossary#5on2) is a 5-minute conversation about any work that will take 2 hours or more. This quick sync-up clarifies how well the work is going and the direction we're headed.

During your 5on2, give a list of the next few steps and ask questions of each other. Finally, discuss any potential roadblocks and then call it done.

## The point is

A quick 5 minutes gives all confidence that everyone is thinking the same thing.

Tomorrow, we'll discuss the Thin Slices method.
