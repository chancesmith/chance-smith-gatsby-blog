When you own the business you have flexibility. When you take ownership of your responsibilities at work you’ll need flexibility to make things happen.

Flexibility requires and _is_ room to wiggle, work, maul, and overwhelm.

Seth Godin speaks of this as _thrashing_.
Garry Vanerchuck considers this as _crushing it_.

Ownership is the ability to make changes.
Ownership is the option to make wild assumptions.

Ownership creates and demands flexibility.

Own your effort, how you get it done, and the results you bring.

You’ll soon be highly rewarded, because you have taken on some of the risk.

Your reward might only be the right education you need to be more successful.

Your work and your results, own it.
