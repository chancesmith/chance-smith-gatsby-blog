Whether your company is outsourcing your phone support overseas or not, please improve your phone support.

Don't know how? Here, let us all pitch in some great ideas.

## Let the phone support scenarios begin
I've split the scenarios up into three sections each.

- Common - what happens often enough
- Ideal - what would be really great
- Improve - a way to improve

Here we go...

## #Call waiting

--------
## ## Common:
- we don't know how long we'll be on hold for

## ## Ideal:
- we could know how much longer until it's our turn
- how many people are available to support the call load?

Improve:
- receive an estimate of time and number in line
- update estimate and number in line every 2-3 mins (or when changed)
- tell us how many representatives are on shift

## #Representative picks up phone

--------
## ## Common:
- answer isn't personal
- we have to repeat ourselves over and over

## ## Ideal:
- know our question before we have to ask it
- save information across calls (phone, past questions)

## ## Improve:
- ask questions while we wait
- answer with our name. "Hey, Chance! ..."
- give representative the most information about us before they pick up the call

## During call with representative

--------
## ## Common:
- we have trouble understanding the outsourced, overseas, support representative

## ## Ideal:
- our knowledgeable neighbor picks up the phone

## ## Improve:
- make the representative's accent that answers relative to the customer's accent

If customers received wonderful support, would they not pay more for your product? I would!

Anybody else agree?
