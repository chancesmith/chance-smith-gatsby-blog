## What is pairing?

Pairing is the practice of two people working together on a single task. This collaboration spreads knowledge about tools, workflows, and project-specific information. Yes, only one task is being completed, but the information is disseminated amongst your team, and decisions are made together.

## When should I pair?

Don't pair 100% of the time. Pair to:

1. Train or skill-up team members.
1. Make decisions about something new. Two brains solving a new problem.
1. Uniformize how we work.

## A Zero entry pool zone

There is no pressure to perform. We're going to figure this out together and make decisions together.

## Follow the practice

- Trade the driver's seat with a rhythm using a timer or a new task.
- Have the navigator be responsible for the timer, giving permission to interrupt to change seats.
- Aim to uniformize how we work and think when on our own.
- Work out loud: Give commentary on your thoughts. Share what you're thinking as you go.

## First day of pairing

Both are typing in the first hour.
Sound collaborative by asking questions. "What if we...?" or "How might we...?"
Make decisions and take breaks together.
