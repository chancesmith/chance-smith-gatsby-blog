The third method of frequent communication is WOL (work out loud).

Working out loud gives updates about what you've done recently and what is coming next. It's also an excellent opportunity to discuss blockers if you have one.

You might say, "But Chance, isn't this a more noisy method of standup?" And you would be correct, but this helps reduce the meetings and gives everyone an insight into what's happening.

## What does a WOL look like?

> WOL: I just finished writing this post. Now, I'm looking at starting tomorrow's post.

You can get extra credit if you give quick options the team can vote on.

> WOL: I'm stuck on latest customer request.
