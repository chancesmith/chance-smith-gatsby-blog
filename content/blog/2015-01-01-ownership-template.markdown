Own your opportunities
Own your ability
Own the risk
Own your results
Own your mistakes
Own your apologies

Taking ownership of your opportunities shifts an idea from something considered into an action taken.
Taking ownership of your errors and mistakes turns the experience from something transactional into a relationship.

Ownership is work. So get to it.
