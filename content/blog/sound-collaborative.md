If we measure how well we collaborate, what areas can we measure?

The distance between us or the number of smiles or laughs we receive. The number of head nods or fist bumps. Well, we can't control all of these.

You'll hear good collaboration when you hear many questions.

Sound collaborative by asking questions like these:

> "What if we...?" -> Proposing a solution.

> "What do you think about...?" -> Considering options together.

> "How might we...?" -> A positive spin to optimize for a desired result.

> "Shall we vote?" -> Vote, discuss, and decide together.

Just like the phrase, "To be enthusiastic, you must act enthusiastic."

If you want to be collaborative, you must start with sounding collaborative.

Lead with questions.
