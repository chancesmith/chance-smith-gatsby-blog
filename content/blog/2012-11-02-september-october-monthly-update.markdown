Two months in one! Sorry, I let time get past me and procrastination get the best of me. I am always trying to be more productive and yet things just don't go as planned. I'm up for bat now and ready to go. So I'm going to forget my lack of _____, _______, and ______ and just move forward. I am sure there are many titles we could give ourselves but lets just stick with the positive.

I got the chance to mini-chat with <a title="Travis Cottrell" href="http://traviscottrell.com/" target="_blank">Travis Cottrell</a> (@<a title="Travis Cottrell Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/cottrelltravis" target="_blank">cottrelltravis</a>) after the service at @<a title="Englewood's Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/ebcjackson" target="_blank">Englewood</a>. It was one of my wife and I's few times to get into Jackson, TN to see a service. But it is always worth it. These people are blessed with productivity and vision. Travis and I agreed that blogging takes so much time and that we could be doing better with out platforms. He had noticed that I hadn't been posting on Twitter. Slacking aside now. I'm making a plan and my goals are set. This can be quite time consuming, but struggles build stronger muscles.
