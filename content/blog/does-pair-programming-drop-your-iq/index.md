There have been many I've met with that were concerned with pair programming. One senior developer said:

I feel my IQ drops 20 points when I pair.
Yeah, some come to pairing feeling pressure or mentally clouded. Others can have opposing personalities.

## How can we adapt?

1. **Ask questions**: Dial up the collaboration and leave room for both to think and speak by asking questions. "What if we...?" or "How might we...?"
2. **Trade on a rhythm**: Make sure none hogs the keyboard. Trade on a failing test or set a 25-minute timer to trade the driver's seat.
3. **Give commentary on the work**: Don't lose your partner. Keep them updated on what you're thinking. This out-load thinking will help them think more like you in the future and pick up where you left off.

You will get comfortable over time. Just like learning a new skill, starting a new job, or working from home for the first time, **you'll need time to adjust**.

The real benefit to pairing, I believe to be the most valuable skill you can have in any field, is duplicating yourself. The sharing of information between the two of you is powerful.
