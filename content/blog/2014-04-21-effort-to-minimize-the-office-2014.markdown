Some of us enjoy moving items around the house or just in our office's to experience a new beginning. Part of shifting things around just feels good. It is also helps in cleaning the area up while giving that _fresh start_ feeling.

After reading [Simplfy](http://www.amazon.com/Simplify-Joshua-Becker-ebook/dp/B006431ADS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398046399&sr=8-1&keywords=simplify), right before we moved north of Jackson, TN, I was inspired to take a more minimalistic lifestyle. That is what the book is about essentially. This is one of the qoutes that motivated me the most.

We are too easily distracted, right?

Moving was going to be hard. We were going from 3,000sqft to 1,300sqft. I had to coax my wife a little, but we were throwing away stuff like crazy. Yet, we were still holding on the the things that meant the most to us and were needed for our daily functions.

It as been 3 months since the move and I felt like the office was closing in on me and I read [this post](http://danabyers.com/2012/09/13/decluttered-office-before-after-pics/). Inspired again. If you see the pictures in the post I don't think I can go to this extreme. Here are my efforts.

Before

Progress:

- emptied a book shelf,removed books from under monitor, and trading them in through Amazon (23 books)
- removed lamp from desk
- moved paper shredder beside living room couch (really close to trash can)
- moved headphones to closet cloths hanger
- desk piece (where headphones were) went in back of bedroom closet

My office closets are next but this is progress I am happy with. It looks but and feels better. I now have the things I need to work and less things to distract me.
