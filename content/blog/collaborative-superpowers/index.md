This week I've been sharing processes and thoughts to dial-up and dial-in the collaboration on your team. Here is a list of the posts.

1. **[Sounding Collaborative](/sound-collaborative/)**

Questions that start converations are powerful. Everything won't sound so definitive and you'll have a better understanding of what your team is thinking.

2. **[Note the Collective](/note-the-collective/)**

Include the team in your wording. It's not just you, it's us. It's not just me, it's we.

3. **[Space for Others](/space-for-others/)**

Give your team space to work. Don't be a bottleneck. Don't be a blocker. Don't be a gatekeeper. Don't hover.

4. **[Autonomy](/autonomy/)**

Give your team the freedom to make decisions, mistakes, and to learn.

5. **[Earning Autonomy](/earning-autonomy/)**

   Communicate often. Build trust. Gain autonomy in your work.

6. **[Communicate for 5 Minutes](/communicate-for-5-minutes/)**

A quick 5 minute meeting can save hours of work. Learn about the 5on2 method.

7. **[Chop Up the Work](/thin-slices/)**

Chopping up your work into Thin-Sliced deliverables is stellar method for communication.

8. **[Work Out Loud](/work-out-loud/)**

Reduce meetings and [3Ws](/glossary#3Ws) by giving your team updates while you make progress on your work.

9. **[United](/united/)**

When united on things that matter to God, nothing is impossible.

10. **[Too Much Noise](/too-much-noise/)**

Conversation channels, emails, and meetings can become incredibly overwhelming.
