This week I've been sharing processes and thoughts to dial-up and dial-in the collaboration on your team. Here is a list of the posts.

1. [Sounding Collaborative](/sound-collaborative/)

Questions that start converations are powerful. Everything won't sound so definitive and you'll have a better understanding of what your team is thinking.

2. [Note the Collective](/note-the-collective/)

Include the team in your wording. It's not just you, it's us. It's not just me, it's we.

3. [Space for Others](/space-for-others/)

Give your team space to work. Don't be a bottleneck. Don't be a blocker. Don't be a gatekeeper. Don't hover.

4. [Autonomy](/autonomy/)

Give your team the freedom to make decisions, mistakes, and to learn.

5. [Earning Autonomy](/earning-autonomy/)

Communicate often. Build trust. Gain autonomy in your work.
