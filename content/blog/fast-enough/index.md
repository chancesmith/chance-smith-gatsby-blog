Companies are always battling the balance of complacency and burnout. Whether you’re firing thousands or hiring to scale the company, the team is pressed to make considerable progress towards the business goals. We’re wondering, are we going fast enough?

At times we ask ourselves this too. We have goals in mind and we don’t want stagnant results.

So, let’s figure out if we’re going fast enough.

## Who would read this?

You’re asking…

- Are we overwhelmed or underwhelmed? 
- are we stagnant, complacent or just tired?
- you’re wondering if the team will ever finish the project. You don’t see any end in sight.
- Are we going fast enough?


## Are we going fast enough?

Let’s discuss three ways you can figure out if you’re going at the right speed.

## 1. Measure

Meet with your team leads and ask how progress is going to meet deadlines. That doesn’t mean we’re driving hard to meet every deadline to a T, but we are wanting to get better at estimating and be sure we’re making trade-offs where we can. This is getting a temperature reading from your team and letting them know how it progresses.

## 2. Set a personals record

Set a goal. A stretch goal. Try a fast pace, large burdened, bit of work for a short period. Do a hard sprint are a stress test. Aim for a personal record to stretch yourself.

Hackathons and hard deadlines are great for pushing you to your limits.

When you’re stressed thin you figure out what works and what is worth sacrificing. Maybe you don’t need full mocks or BEM classes to get the immediate result.

When you’re pressed, you’ll learn, and you’ll grow.

## 3. Learn and Burn

Use the slow times to try something small and new. Try a [rapid prototype](/rapid-prototype-framework), from last week’s post. You can try something small, a bite size trial to either learn or responsibly fail.

If you fail, it’s okay. You can burn this little experiment to the ground. Build, try, and move on.
