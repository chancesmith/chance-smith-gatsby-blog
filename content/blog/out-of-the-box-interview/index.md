Surprise!

Just kidding. There are no surprises in the interviews I've done.

I tell candidates exactly what's coming.

Why? Because I'm not testing their ability to handle surprises.
I'm measuring their ability to prepare and transfer knowledge.

The format:

1. Ice breaker
2. Share your interest and enthusiasm
3. Teach me something

Knowing doesn't make it easier. It makes it harder.

They have to choose: What passion? What to teach?

I say: "You're the brain. I'm the hands."

Simple tasks don't cut it. Complex tasks reveal their ability to think, explain, and engage.

Can they break down ideas?<br/>
Adapt when I play dumb?<br/>
Keep me interested?

## The point is

An interview isn't a time to monologue about your company. It's a time to learn about the candidate.

Some might say: "Won't they just prepare perfect answers?"

Exactly. I want their best. I want to see them prepare and shine.

That's what companies need.

## A leave behind

Here's a message I send to prepare them:

```
Thanks for agreeing to an interview! I want you to lead the interview. Here's how to prepare:

1. Tell us about you and your experience (5 minutes max).
2. Choose a topic you're passionate about to discuss for 2 minutes.
3. Prepare to teach me a multi-step process (5 minutes max). I'll be the hands, you'll be the brain.
Examples: Using a wood burner safely, solving a complex math problem, how to do a magic trick, or tie useful knots.

Bring any props you need.
Afterwards, we can discuss any details and ask questions. Can't wait to learn from you!
```
