Since it is snowing outside and my wife and son are home I thought I would give you guys the low-down on what it's like to work in the same place you live.

No matter how #frozen your car is, when you #workRemotely you still have to work.

When you work from home everyone always sees the grass on my side being greener. Now I won't lie, it's awesome! I wouldn't change a thing but here is a list I will update as I piece this new work-lifestyle together.

#Remote Work: the good
* no commute (less gas and no fuss)
* freedom to work how you want to (underwear, headphones)
* home cooked meals
* little to no temptation to eat out

#Remote Work: the bad
* less collisions with other people
* local distractions (chores, family)

#Remote Work: the combo
* accountability to work on work
* less people around

Working from home makes you work on your self control to be effective, efficient, and trustworthy.
