After a few days of just looking at the snow I decided to get out his morning and take a few video shots and put them together. It may be just for my benefit but I hope it's worth watching at least once.

I haven't made any efforts to get the camera out in awhile and I thought this was a good oppurtinuty to. I hope you enjoy it, cheers!
