UPDATED: 5/10/2023 - new song

It's true, I repeat the same song over and over. My longest run I believe is 3 months (12 weeks). I'll only do this when I'm working on a development project or project management work. Otherwise, I'll listen to nothing or white noise.

## It's not just me

I found recently that Tools of Titans by Timothy Ferriss talks about this being a productivity hack. So, I'm not alone in finding this method of productivity.

## Fun fact: I don't know the lyrics

When I'm listening, I am enjoying the rythum and can say most of the lyrics as it plays, but I don't remember any lyrics or the name of the song.

## The list

So, I'd thought I'd recall, record, and share the songs.

Here is a list of songs I've repeated over the years:
