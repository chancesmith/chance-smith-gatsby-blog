As Christmas heads our way, families and team members are creating lists for gift swapping.

Instead of spending lots of time creating those lists, I've created a solution

## The Solution
Just list the names and begin the gift swapping.

## The App
Last year I created a simple web application to make this a breeze. Feel free to go back and [read the initial details](http://blog.chancesmith.org/gift-match-app/).

No more writing, hat drawing, or cat skinning. Make it fast and simple.

Still want to spend time together in the process? Pass a phone around.

Checkout the app: https://giftmatch.herokuapp.com/

## The Update
After one year, I'm giving this app a little update:

- shuffle button added on results page

You can still click the "edit" button to go back to edit the list. Yet, now you can touch the "shuffle" button until you have the perfect list.

Cheers!
