Here are the guidelines we follow when making PRs.

1. branch off `main` (don't push to main)
2. keep PRs small (Primagen says to keep PRs down to 150 lines [youtube](https://youtu.be/ihFoFqvZhCM?t=622))
3. one review before you **squash-merge** into `main`
4. In PR notes, comment on code changes to give in-line context
5. use a template for all to follow: purpose, changes, screenshot. (see below)

```
## Purpose of PR
<!-- What this PR does in 1-2 sentences. If it can't fit in 1-2 sentences, the PR may be changing too much (no big deal, try to keep commits and PRs short next time!) -->

## Changes Made
<!-- Bulleted list of all the changes this PR introduces -->
-

## Screenshots
<!-- Please provide any relevant screenshots or videos. (Loom is a great choice) -->
```
