Next7 is to note your next seven: months, days, tasks.

Seven months, days, and tasks give you the horizon down to your feet. You'll know your next steps and where you're heading.

Next7 shows if you have a plan.

Seven could be any number, but planning too far out is guessing. Planning too close hidesyour desired outcome. Seven is a good balance.

Write out your Next7 when you feel distracted.
Ask for your Next7 if you need help understanding the plan.

## Example

Here's what it looks like.

**7 Months**: Launch MVP in 2 months and finish Feature D and F

**7 Days**: Get the iOS app in Alpha release

**7 Tasks**:

1. Fix the login bug
2. finish feature C
3. ...
4. ...
5. ...
6. ...
7. ...

If you do this once a month or each week, you can get feedback to ensure you're heading in the right direction.

## Next Step

Write out your Next7 and share it with the team.

## The point is

It's easier to edit than create.
So, plan a little. Carve out your next few tasks and get to it.
Sharing this practice with your team will help you get feedback and stay on track.
