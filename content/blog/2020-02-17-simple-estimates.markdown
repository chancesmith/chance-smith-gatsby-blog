At [Sodium Halogen](https://sodiumhalogen.com?ref=chancesmithio-blog), we gather up-front estimates for all of the projects we do. Part of getting a estimate together is doing a discovery call or workshop. During our discovery, we find out what our customer wants and how we can exceed their expectation.

**A discovery call/workshop length should be relative to the size of the upcoming project.**

Some projects are small. Here are some questions to ask when the work will only take less than a day.

1. Why do you need a new [project-topic-here]?
1. Why not do nothing at all?
1. Why work with us?

That's it!

Save your customer's time. For new customers and small engagements, keep it short and sweet.
