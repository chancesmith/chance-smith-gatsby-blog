Here I have built a web application that creates email signatures based on a static design. The design would need to change for each company or individual but...yeah, this is for an agency or web developer that happens to make a email signature.

#Demo links

- [signature creator app demo](https://chancesmith.io/project/signature-app/)
- [github](https://github.com/chancesmith/chancesmith-site/tree/master/project/signature-app)

#Why?
A [Sodium Halogen](https://sodiumhalogen.com?ref=csio) client made a request for us to design and code them a email signature. They needed 7-8 different signatures for different team members.

With the number of signatures needed I asked these questions:

- Will they need more email signatures made in the future?
- Could I give them a tool for them to create their own?
- Could that tool be rigid enough so no one could alter the design?

The answer was yes to all three. Thus an app is born.

#Who uses this app?
A company that want's to keep a consistent email signature. They want to give the power to team members to create and implement their own email signatures.

#Aftermath
What do you think of the app?
Would you like me to setup an email signature creator for your company?
