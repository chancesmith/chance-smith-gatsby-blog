When you’re stuck, screencast the issue you’re having and send it to someone

Screencasts allow for asynchronous meetings and help you move on to the next task while you wait.

Here I sent a Loom conducting a 5on2 meeting asynchronously

Another example of this is like asking a question on Reddit or StackOverflow. Wherever you post your question, once you’ve posted your question, you can start a new task while you wait for an answer.

Asynchronous meetings are still a form of batching up your questions, so you’re asking all your questions at a time that is convenient for your team.

Joining an asynchronous meeting means I can attend/consume when it’s convenient and consume at a convenient pace (2.5-3.5x speed).
