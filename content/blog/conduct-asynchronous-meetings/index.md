When you’re stuck, screencast the issue you’re having and send it to someone.

Screencasts allow for asynchronous meetings and help you move on to the next task while you wait.

Here I sent a list next tasks to a colleague in our Discord chat and a Loom conducting a 5on2 meeting asynchronously.

Another example is asking a question on Reddit or StackOverflow. Wherever you post your question, once you’ve posted your question, you can start a new task while you wait for an answer.

Asynchronous meetings are still a form of batching up your questions, so you’re asking all your questions at one time that is convenient for your team.

Joining an asynchronous meeting means I can attend/consume when it’s convenient and consume at a convenient pace (2.5-3.5x speed).
