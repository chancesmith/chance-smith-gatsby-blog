Last spring, I conducted a A/B test on a clients site, [Goodman Ranch](http://goodmanranch.com).

#Problem to Solve
As of yet, the homepage was not creating trackable leads.

#Solution
Create a more minimal homepage with a form to capture leads.

#Results
The winning variation of the test resulted in a 5% less bounce rate and 1**.**02% conversion rate.

#Original Homepage

#Winning Variation

#Aftermath
Moving forward it would be best to keep testing for a better conversion rate. The bounce rate is at a all time low of 22%.

I would suggest at this point to:

- make the homepage more minimal
- clean up css styles
- keep testing what pictures and text convert better with the form.
