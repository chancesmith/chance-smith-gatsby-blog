Here is how I consume audio content at rapid speeds. I've done this for the fast ten years, or so. All thanks goes to the speed feature of iTunes and Audible.

**Warning**: I'll admit my retention level diminishes greatly using this method.

**Step one**: Listen to audio at the fastest speed possible for sixty seconds.

**Step two**: bring the speed down one level at a time until it is understandable and comprehendable.

Try bringing the speed back up if you feel you have adjusted or just want to try a faster speed again.

Sometimes it depends on the speaker, audio quality, and hardware.

**Extra tip**: Youtube has this feature too. Great for lecture type content.
