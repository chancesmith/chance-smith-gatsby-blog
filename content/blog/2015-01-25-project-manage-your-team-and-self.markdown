Here are the questions I ask to keep myself productive. I'll also share a video next on how I use Asana, project management tool, to orginiaize my team, work and self.

Questions:

* What is in the queue for today?
* What is the availablility?
	* How busy are you?
	* When can you take on more work?
* Your cost in hours?
	* How long does it take to complete each task?

Setup:

The setup to asnwer the above would be, you have each task in a list or queue to complete each project. Then, each task is assigned to a person and date. Lastly, add time estimate to each task.

Tip:

In cases of emergencies or under estimation of hours to complete a task, I only schedule out 5-6 hours per person per day. This gives some room to get ahead and not get swapped.
