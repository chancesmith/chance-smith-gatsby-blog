My wife thinks her day is cursed if she writes her todo list down. Once it hits her paper she believes that it will not get done. I have to agree that I have this problem from time to time. If I just fly by the seat of my pants I can get a whole lot done that I didn't have to plan for. Now there are two parts to this and I hope you take these ideas and turn them in to a action plan of your own.

A trait of a successful person is a person that: <strong>Accomplishes the Goals They Set</strong>

<strong>What if I get more done without a list?</strong>
Great! You are like the majority of the world, all of who do not have lists. Though you are getting a lot of things accomplished through your day you didn't have a goal in mind. You didn't have a plan. There was no moment in your day where you can say, "I got everything done that I planned to do today!" You only say, "I got a lot done today!" Both of those phrases are great to say when the day is done. You did get <em>something</em> done. Which some can't even say that. You need to have a goal to hit, a larger moment of success, and the guts to push yourself to the limit. Your list that you write or type up every morning can help with that.

<strong>Why do I fail at my todo list?
</strong>You really think you are failing todo lists? No, not really. You suck at accomplishing you goals. You need to make your todo list a priority. If you need to start a book, workout, and finish a sales report before the day is up you need to do them now. Maybe not now, but before lunch. Either you are a firefighter and keep getting interrupted or the items on your list are not as high of a priority to you as you thought. I think you know the answer and I think you know you have what it takes to knock out your list.

<strong>Why else could I be failing?
</strong>-Your list is to long
-Your items need to be broken down into smaller steps
-You can't track or measure the goal in mind
-Maybe you lose your list or the dog ate it

<strong>How do I stay motivated?
</strong>-Write your list every morning
-Make your list simple and small (three-five items)
-Keep the list with you and look at it often
-Track and measure your success
-Encourage your spouse or friend to join you(<em>No competing</em>. Encouragement only)

Here is a tool(worksheet) I made to help list daily and weekly goals that <a title="Creating Productive Moments" href="https://www.chancesmith.org/creating-productive-moments/" target="_blank">you can download</a>.
