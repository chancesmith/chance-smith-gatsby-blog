All credit goes to William Donnell. We both talked about projects, and William quickly noted I was using too many pronouns. I discussed many people at once, and it was easier to say the pronouns than everyone's name.

Prime example when I was talking with our second son today:

> Carter, go tell Mason it's time for dinner. _He_ then came to dinner.

Who is the _he_ in that sentence?

## The point is

When discussing many people, beware of messing up the story for everyone else by using too many pronouns.
