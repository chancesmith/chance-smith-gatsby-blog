With a completely new company and only knowing the following, the journey began at creating a logo for Medina Buzz:

#What I knew about Medina Buzz:

- service was the delivery of news
- service was going to be for Medina, TN (hince - medina)
- Medina, TN sports teams were themed around hornets (hince - buzz)
- service would be delivered via the web

#What I aimed for:

- minimal
- responsive
- less assotionation with sports but still following the city's schools mascot

Eric Egbert, founder, sent this sketch to me to work with.

I spent a good gallon of midnight oil free sketching ideas. Let's begin...

(below) Here the responsive pieces begin.

(below) Here is where I began in Illustrator. I ended up not starting with a sketch but thought of something similar to origami. It didn't work out.

(below) I started forming the hornet more here. Small changes to make it more aggressive. The silhouette helped keep it minimal without leaning into a sports team like symbol.

(below) I show dfferent font options. #5 looked to like a fashion magazine.

#Aftermath
Some of the responsive options rose a question to me as I gathered this info. Does it matter if the logo more reconsizable than it is legable?

I think some of the unique responsive options would help it standout in some cases.

#What I wish I had done differently
I should have put the logo in context: top of a website, hat, shirt, billboard, merch button, or sticker.

It would have made it more real to put the logo in places it would end up. Context matter.
