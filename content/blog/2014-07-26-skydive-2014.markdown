After scuba diving down 100ft in Mexico I've always known I wanted to skydive. I just never knew when I was going to do it. My wife, Molly, decided to surprise me and gift a skydive. Best gift ever! All I had to do was set a date. She made this dream real.

So to knock off an item on [my bucket list](http://chancesmith.org/bucketlist)...

A tandem skydive 14,550ft high. Falling at 120 mph until 6,000ft. Parachuting for the remainder for an excellent view of the outskirts of Nashville.

Watch the dive below:
