Our second son asks for help every time he plays a game. I ask if there is any danger if he fails.

I say, "You can try it on your own the first time whenever there is no danger."

Sometimes we are too early to ask for help. We're risk-averse to the point that we fear failing. Yet, failing is an amazing teacher.

## The point is

You should never hesitate when there is no risk. Just do it.

Ask for help if there's a fear you'll mess up with no recovery.
