Okay, in this 'collaboration collection', we've talked about many methods to keep everyone involved on the same page. Some of you see all this and say, "We're spending **way** too much time communicating."

I hear that as meaning, "We're spending too much time collaborating."

One reminder from scripture is that God created and tasked us to do great things together.

> Tower of Babel: "The Lord said, 'If they have begun to do this as one people all having the same language, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.' (Gen 11:6 CBS) https://read.lfwy.to/&7VbrRw

When united on things that matter to God, nothing is impossible.

## The point is

There are great outcomes from working together well. There are few reasons to avoid any collaborative effort.

Yes, there are concerns about communication being too "noisy". That topic will be for tomorrow.
