<strong>What is a Mission Statement?</strong>

Mission Statement most likely reminds you of some generic statement on the wall of your company lobby or some highlighted phrase in your hiring paperwork. This statement was the focus of the company. Most CEO's or executives don't know their mission statement that their HR director created.

<strong>A mission statement are your:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>skills</li>
	<li>passions</li>
	<li>dreams</li>
	<li>values</li>
	<li>goals</li>
</ul>

Having a mission statement is a trait of a successful person. Successful people make decisions based on their mission statement everyday and every hour.
