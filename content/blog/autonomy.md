In this thread of collaboration, starting at [Sounding Collaborative](/sound-collaborative/),

Everyone on your team needs autonomy: space to think without distraction and some need to recharge. But most important is the absolute ownership of our work.

Here are some questions I ask to help frame my autonomy:

How long should I work on this before getting feedback? ([3Ws](/glossary#3ws))
Would anyone else benefit from seeing this work? ([bus-co](https://www.sodiumhalogen.com/glossary#bus-coefficiency) and [pairing](https://www.sodiumhalogen.com/pairing))
Is this the first time I've done this, or has anyone on the team?

We need to balance collaboration and work ownership. We only work our work questioned with some decisions. Let's decide on the big things and give ownership of how to get there.
