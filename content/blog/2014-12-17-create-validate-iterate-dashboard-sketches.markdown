Thus far [I have explained](https://blog.chancesmith.org/iterating-off-of-ash-mauryas-lean-dashboard/) the source and thinking behind this dashboard.

I'll now show you my progress with these sketches.

The visual flow was been my biggest concern as a sketched. I wanted the user to always know where to go next as they navigate the dashboard.

#Sketches
After a couple of sketches, attempting to use the Lean Dashboard layout, for a restaurant, I decided to redo the layout entirely. It just didn't fit.

Here I'm retaining the horizontal/landscape layout but pulling in a wheel/circle to create flow.

The circular flow was interesting but the circle shape wasn't doing the trick. I also tried an illustration of a funnel here.

I continued with much simpler illustration, but decided it wouldn't be taken as seriously and had less structure to follow.

Starting from scratch and only thinking about the pieces I need, I sketched a more linear flow in a vertical/portrait view. The arrows helped show flow of information and the repeating iterative phase.

One style came to mind that [William Donnell](https://sodiumhalogen.com) had used with his website briefs. I gave it a quick sketch...

Further refined.

Refined again. Along with a test from Molly, the super wife.

Here I zoom out and label the areas to get a big picture of the new dashboard.

## Aftermath

I am happy with how far away I've moved from the original design of the Lean Dashboard. With a little more work and strategy I feel this can be a tool to be used.

Most importantly the flow is clearer. Due to the arrows, they help give guidance and navigation cues for the user's eyes.

Here is a clear picture of direction I did in Skitch.

## Worries

I'm fearful of how the goals will fit in the Future section. Also, I'm wondering how big this will have to be. With 8.5" x 11" as a starting point, we'll see how it works on something bigger.

## Next Phase

Next I will be taking this design to a whiteboard and start running it through a few trials. Then either make more changes or move onto real use cases.
