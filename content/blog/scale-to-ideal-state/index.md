Don't compare yourself to anyone else.<br/>
Don't begin at an extreme.<br/>
You'll burn out.<br/>
You'll lose.<br/>

ðŸ˜Œ ~ breath ~

Reset.<br/>
Start small.<br/>
Let God lead.<br/>
Show up every day.<br/>
Grow into the future you.<br/>
Start thinking about the reps.<br/>
Narrow your focus to achieve more.<br/>
Observe the volume you've completed.<br/>
You'll turn back and see how far you've come.

This is for you and me. I know I'm not the only one dealing with overambitious and self-sabotage. Let's set a good example for ourselves.
