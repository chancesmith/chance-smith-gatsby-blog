Don't compare yourself to anyone else.
Don't begin at an extreme.
You'll burn out.
You'll lose.

Reset.
Start small.
Let God lead.
Show up every day.
Grow into the future you.
Start thinking about the reps.
Narrow your focus to achieve more.
Observe the volume you've completed.
You'll turn back and see how far you've come.

This is for you and me. I know I'm not the only one dealing with overambitious and self-sabotage. Let's set a good example for ourselves.
