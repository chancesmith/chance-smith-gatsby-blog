Want to make things personal for your clients?

Add your face. No, not just pictures.

Add gifs! Done.

At Sodium Halogen, [William](https://sodiumhalogen.com) (founder) encrouaged me to use animated gifs to help make our emails stand out to our clients. I have taken that advice and stepped it up a few levels.

**I make my own.**

My hope is to keeps my emails fun and personal for the people that help pay for my talents. Here is how I stand out in the sea of emails, no matter where I'm working from.

Here is my **Top 10 Gif Collection for 2014** and how I use them.

Client: "Great Job!"
Me: "Thank you. Insert cool thumbs here. #gif"
