At Sodium Halogen, for years, we've asked our teams to self-evaluate and check how they're doing overall. Here are the questions we ask each team member every 3-months.

## Quarterly Checkup Questions

1. What's one thing you're excited about?
1. What's one thing you're worried about?
1. What's one thing SH can do better to help you with your job?
1. What's one thing you can do to improve your job?
1. What's a frustration you have had (or heard) over the past three months?
1. What is a [3-month goal](/3-month-goals) you can set that will be a win-win-win?

## The point is

No matter the questions you use, it's important to get a tempature reading from your team and set expectations for the next 3-months.
