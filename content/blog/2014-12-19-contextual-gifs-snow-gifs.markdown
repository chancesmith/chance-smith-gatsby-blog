It's winter, close to Christmas and I couldn't resist getting some new gifs in. I even added a little snow to them. I figured why need be contextual to the season with my gifs.

Remeber, this is how I exceed our clients expectations and have my emails standout. [It's all about animated gifs](http://blog.chancesmith.org/making-customer-service-and-email-personal/).

I pulled [Luke Pennington](http://www.lukepennington.org/), from [Sodium Halogen](https://sodiumhalogen.com?ref=csio), in to help show our customers how much fun we have serving them.

Also, just a great 20min rabbit hole away from our laptops and screens. Worth it.

Here are the gifs and how I'll use them:

ME: "Operators standing by...in the snow. #gif"

ME: "Task is done. Hi5 time! #gif"

ME: "How about some snowy thumbs to celebrate! #gif"

See the lot of my gifs:
