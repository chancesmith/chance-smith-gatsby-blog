Like reps in your exercises, the more you do something, the more comfortable you'll be.

You're Grandfather's drill press or Grandmother's blender is overwhelming at first but less overwhelming after you've used them a hundred times.

## For example

The concert pianist is less nervous on stage now x compared to her first recital.

With hundreds/thousands listening, the MC or podcaster doesn't panic because they've done this a thousand times before.

Feel uncomfortable? Most likely, this is the first time you have been here or done this thing. Go get some reps in.

## The point is

You need reps.

You'll improve with the volume of iterations, not just the time spent.

Don't aim for perfection if you want to get good at something. Instead, find ways to get the smallest reps in.
