Incase you haven't heard we first we need to talk about what Test Driven Development (TDD) is.

## TDD?

It's a seemingly simple workflow. you just write tests first and then write code that passes your tests. Just one at a time. Yeah, sounds nuts. So dumb, right?! Let me explain the steps...

1. RED: Write a failing test
2. GREEN: Write just enough production code to past that test
3. REFACTOR: Refactor any of your code without failing a test. Stay green.

These steps are all thanks to Kent Beck and Uncle Bob. Go read their books. Back to TDD...

This is a simple but challenging process. You will struggle, but with much software enegineering maturity you will get better at this. Start now. Worry about doing it wrong later.

## Why you need TDD

Let's list the ways:

- less browser refreshing, because your tests are testing that part of the code for you
- run your code less, because your tests are testing that part of the code for you
- let the failing tests show you what to go fix or add next
- refactor or abstract anything you want, just keep the green lights on

## How do I start writing tests?

Go Google "How to write test in python" or "Javascript TDD." Watch and read all you can.

Here is a [collection of testing videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6xHKLqatXtBqAv9XmPyAIZk-UuaZtNyz) that our team found helpful to get us started.

Also use Katas, the act of practicing to memorize and perfect a form or movements. Katas work in development and help us get into a new programming language and especially learn to test our code. Here is a small javascript [todo-list kata](https://github.com/chancesmith/tdd-todo-list) our team created and talk about often of how we add tests to frontend logic and UI.

## Go write some tests

I'm going to say it again...

Start now. Worry about doing it wrong later.

## Need help getting started

Our team would be [happy to help you get started](https://sodiumhalogen.com?ref=chancesmith.io) when testing Python, C#, or Javascript.
