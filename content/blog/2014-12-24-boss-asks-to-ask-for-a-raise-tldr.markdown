I’ve challenged my team to all ask for a raise in 2015, and here is what I said.

—-

You don’t get more because of what you are capable of, but rather for what you have done.

Your past is proof and your future is opportunity.

Dream about your skills being one notch better.
Take action on things you aren’t sure about.
Prove what you think you can do.
