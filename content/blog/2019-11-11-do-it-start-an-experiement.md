If everything is always changing.<br/>
How are we changing to adapt?<br/>
How do we adapt?<br/>
<br/>
Just start an experiment.<br/>
Try something new.<br/>
Sure, ask for permission. But who can say "No" to trying something once?<br/>
<br/>

## a model of a experiment

It's simple. Remove, add or replace a habit, clutter, friend, meeting time, etc...

## experiments to try

- archive all inboxed emails
- unsubscribe from all emails
- [reduce your kids toys to 25%](./2019-11-11-boys-and-fewer-toys/)
- reduce dishes in kitchen to just enough for one meal
- limit focused work to 25mins, then take a break #pomodoro
- at work, everyone goes headsdown for an hour right after lunch
- make big goals or make small goals
- plan your week, and don't plan your next week

## measuring your experiments

- How do you feel? More self constraint or expansion?
- Are you happy with the results? Continue, stop, or change?
