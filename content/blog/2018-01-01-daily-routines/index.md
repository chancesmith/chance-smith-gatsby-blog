Making progress every single day. To look back 90 days and see a good record of effort and a ton of work done, that would be awesome!

After reading ["The Compound Effect" by Darren Hardy](http://amzn.to/2CzeXC8) (a must read), it was clear that I needed to be more consistent with my actions for reaching the goals I had set. With this new year I want to reach my goals. I want to stay focused. I want this to be the best year yet.

Focus...that means I need to keep my goals front of mind. I need to review them. I need a system.

I needed to stop drifting and to stop being so drivin.

Routines can help with this. For us to succeed we'll need routines that will be simple and rewarding. Let's do it! 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

## Warp up

My overarching goals are to: read more 📚, share progress 🎤, more fit 💪, and more focused 👀.

I was able to make these routines by listing out the items I wanted to make progress on everyday.

I'm excited about 2018 and hoping to make it fun and memorable. Here we go...day one.
