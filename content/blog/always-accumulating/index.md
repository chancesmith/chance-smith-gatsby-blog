We're constantly accumulating in many areas of our lives.

Tools <br/>
Solutions <br/>
Processes <br/>
Apps <br/>
Cloths <br/>
Communication channels <br/>
Subscriptions<br/>
Notifications<br/>
Furniture

There are some we can't stop...

Steps<br/>
Memories<br/>
Ideas<br/>
Progress

There is one that slips through our fingers...

Time

Do we ever try going back-to-zero for all the ones we accumulate and have control over?

## The point is

We take on more and more everyday.<br/>
Find ways to turn off the flow.<br/>
Try starting back at zero.<br/>
Nothing.<br/>
Zero<br/>
