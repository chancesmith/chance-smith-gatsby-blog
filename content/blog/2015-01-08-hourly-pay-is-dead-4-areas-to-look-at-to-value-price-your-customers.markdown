If you need an introduction into value pricing, check out [The Businessology Show](http://www.businessology.biz/). It’s a must.

Here are the 4 areas that I measure to help me price projects.

#Demand
Are you in demand?
How are available are you right now?

#Deadline
What is this project’s deadline?
How much midnight oil must I burn?

#Strategy
Is there room to be strategic?
Is there room to offer more than asked for?

#Results
What is the value and life span of a customer, for client?
If this brought 1 customer to client, what value what that bring?

#Lastly (4 + 1)
Can you deliver?
