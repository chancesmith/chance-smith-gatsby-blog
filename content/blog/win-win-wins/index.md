If you are learning something new or want to improve, find ways to pair three or more activities together.

## Build an Activity Stack

Let's say you wanted to read more, improve your typing, and learn about gardening or parentin (any topic).

You could find a blog post you want to read and copy the content into a typing practice app, like [MonkeyType.com](https://monkeytype.com). You would be typing, reading, and learning all at the same time. Win-win-win.

The typing example above aligns well with copy-work, copying other creators to learn from and embody their techniques and working methods. If you want to improve at writing, copy the work of an author or editor you admire.

## The point is

Get the most out of your time by finding ways to combine activities. Employ the [activity stacking](/glossary#activity-stacking) method.
