Take someone with no knowledge of computer programming and get them started with JavaScript.

Do you want to build apps or solve problems using technology?

## JavaScript can get you there. It's:

- the most ubiquitous programming language around
- the foundation of popular frameworks like React and Angular
- what gives web pages the ability to interact

## The Workshop

Hi, I'm Chance Smith! In this workshop, I'll help you build a foundation in JavaScript. We will start out with common parts in JavaScript, build up to variables and functions, and finally use GitHub Pages to put your code on the web. Please email me at [chance@sodiumhalogen.com](mailto:chance@sodiumhalogen.com) if you have questions at all.

**By the end of the workshop, you will:**

- be able to write common statements and expressions

- have something running on the world wide web
- be equipped with the tools you need to keep learning and building JavaScript applications
