we would rather bundle up another large engagement or phase of work.

So the question we're asking now is (thinking about FunFact), how do we handle micro changes after V1 is launched?

We don't want micro estimates so we we need to do a Strategy Session to surface high-value/high-impact ideas that are +MLOE.
