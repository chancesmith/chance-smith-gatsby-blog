title: Your customers love value pricing
---

Hourly pricing can devalue your service. Honest pay for honest work is still in play with value pricing. I'm talking about giving what your customer what they want in every service you deliver.

## Product = Service

To keep this simple, a product is a service too. The effort it takes to design and create your product is the service you provide. Your product may be the thing your customer engages with, but the work your team puts into making it awesome was the service you delivered.

That way you don't see a bunch of "product/service"'s all over the place. With that out of the way... :)

## What is value pricing?

While still covering cost and making a profit, value pricing is a pricing strategy to price a service where the customer receives more perceived value than they pay for.

To break down the components of value pricing, in an earlier post, I asked the [questions of how to value price a customer](http://blog.chancesmith.org/hourly-pay-is-dead-4-areas-to-look-at-to-value-price-your-customers/).

## Why customers love value pricing

Value pricing is helping to ensure that the exchange between the business and customer is a fantastic experience. Here is how that is so.

### Knowing the price upfront

There is no surprise price when the hours are tallied up.

The hourly rate is never given to the customer. Instead, an estimate is collected and shared with the client before any work is done. They know what to expect and know how it's going to fit in the budget before the project ever begins.

To make an estimate, you'll first need to know as much about the project before starting. Preparation is crucial.

### They'll never pay for more than received

The value the customer receives from your service is never less than the price they'll pay.

A simple investment principle: never put more in than you intend to reap a return from. When you value pricing you want to price the project to where your customer will always reap a greater return than what they paid you. Happy customersâ€‹ come back.
