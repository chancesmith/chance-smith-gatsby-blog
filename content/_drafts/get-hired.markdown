title: Get the intership. Get hired.
---

You want a career you love. You're craving work that matters. You want to standout and get your foot in the door for your next, maybe first, job.

## Let's begin

I'll share example questions and such as if you were wanting to apply at Sodium Halogen, the current team I work with.

I've interviewed nearly hundreds of candidates and hired Over 200 of them. I know what will help you standout and look great.

## You must be great, and not a great actor.

If you really have great ambision and can really put forth effort to excell, you'll do great. Keep reading...

## Find someone that works at your dream job

Make the connection with someone that already works at the company of your current dreams (dreams change, I get it).

Kick off the convo sharing that you're really interested in working with Company-X. Then begin learing about what they do and how they like their job.

## Ask them the right questions

– What are you guys working on?
– What are the challenges you see at Sodium Halogen?

You're fishing for indicators of neds you can fill or their need for more talent.

## Modify, Fill-in, and Send this email

Filling in the Challenges and Solutions for Company-X will just be the start. The last 4 statements will be more challenging.

You'll need to also replace Sodium-Halogen/SH for the company you want to join and replace my name with the person you want to talk to, but get this email out.

Hey, `**HIREE**`!

`**Chance**` and I had talked this week about what it would look like if I temporarily joined Sodium Halogen for 3 or so months. The last update from Chance was that it might not be the right time just yet. (<-- If that is the case. :D )

I completely understand, but I thought I could at least make an attempt to convince you otherwise.

SH's Challenges

1.  staying in budget and keeping deadlines on current and future projects
2.  being staffed-up/skilled-up for vaster workloads
3.  hiring and training the right people

SH's Solution

1.  hiring new and teachable talent on the cheap
2.  duplicating your current high achievers (knowledge sharing)
3.  giving super-eager candidates a shot

If you can create this email and show you really care to do great things that benefit everyone, you'll have no problem getting in.
