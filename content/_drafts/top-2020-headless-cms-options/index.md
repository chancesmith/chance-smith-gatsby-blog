At [Sodium Halogen](https://sodiumhalogen.com?ref=chancesmithio-blog), we have explored Wordpress being a Headless CMS for Gatsby.

Wait...wait...

## What is a Headless CMS?

## What are the benefits of a Headless CMS?

From a development perspective, you are abstracting the CMS from the views. Now, your software or website isn't directly attached to the CMS you use, just as long as your data structure is the same. You can now change to any CMS you want in the future. [Uncle Ben would be so proud.]()

Gatsby makes that really easy.

## What is Gatsby?

Static-Site Generator. You take your data/content and have a static-site generator build all of your pages into tidy HTML files. Now you have every page of your site ready to deliver in the fastest way possible.

With Wordpress, every user, for every page, is built by the server on request. The server keeps doing the same work with the same data every time a user visits the website and changes to a new page. This is slower and a waste of resources.

Static-site generators build all your pages into ready-to-serve HTML files.
