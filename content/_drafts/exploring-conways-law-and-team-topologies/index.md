Within my team, we're discussing how our team is currently structured and how we manage a number of projects and the business areas we support.

We've distilled down that we support 3 high-level business domains. So, our lead engineer as brought up Team Topologies, a book on reorganizing teams to that better fit the customer and business needs.

We're looking to create 3 teams to support these domains.

Some important questions a team member asked were, "Do we need to all be in the same standup? Could we not have a single person represent a smaller team in the standup? Maybe we meet less often?"

Then our principle developer said, "Well with Conway's Law, we should be structured to match the architecture of the system we're building." In other words, how can we structure our teams and communication to match the experience our customers have with our product?

## What to know about Conway's Law

I find analogies tell a better story than a definition.

We find an insurance company experience frustrating when the auto loan department rep has no idea of the other products we have with the company. We have to repeat our information and the rep has to loop up our information in the system. We're frustrated because the company is not structured to match the experience we have with the company.

Ideally all insurance reps would have access to all our information under one system. This would mean the reps are in teams

## Value of re-organization of our team

1. **business can make a request** – “If the architecture of the system and the architecture of the organization are at odds, the architecture of the organization wins.”
2. **focused teams for speed** – "We need to put the team first, advocating for restricting their cognitive loads."

## What are the ways we can work in and with these teams well? (consistency, communication, collective.conwaysLaw)

- How does my team stay focused, avoiding distractions of outside domains? (slack channels, jira cards, meetings)
- How does my team make decisions that align with the dream outcome?

TL;DWatch

> Amazon had a monolithic codebase that would take 8 hours to compile and a VP to approve a release. Then Jeff B. said this needs to be fixed; we need 2PizzaTeams, small teams that can own and author changes with strong contracts between other teams.

> Working on a "2 Pizza team" is not a promotion or all glamorous, but it's about pioneering, a journey.

> The 2PizzaTeems must be excellent at sharing and failing out loud to the other teams so we all learn together as a shared journey.

## The point is
