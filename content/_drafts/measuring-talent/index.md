How do you evaluate talent in the knowledge-work space?

You might be a techinical recruiter hiring for you client or a department lead looking for looking to you build your team. You're trying to find the right person (character, skillset, personality).

At this point, I've interviewed hundereds of candidates and hired north of 100. Here is my take on evaluting skilled and non-skilled candidates before you hire.

## no code challenges homework

I'm not in favor of code challenges for measuring someones skill level. I believe it's a waste of the candidates time and doesn't help my company solve real problems.

Like the homework I did back in school. The school work was about a grade and not about becoming a problem-solver. Most of the work is not based on a real prolem that needs solving.

It's great to step through examples and think critically.

CoOps, internships, and job shadows are perfect for this.
