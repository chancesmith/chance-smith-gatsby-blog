At SH***, we bring on new team member in a number of ways. We'll have 5-10 job shadows, 2-4 internships, and 2-3 trail periods a year. Each path has a role in helping find good fits. We're looking for win-win of course.

I thought I'd share our processes and practices that help us bring talent to our team.

## engaging job shadows

For those interested in UX, software and product design, the job shadows are a full day with a team member. You're working side by side on real work. This is an oppurtinity to meet our team and ask us quesitons.

This isn't your normal job shadow. There is nothing really passive about it. One goal is to have contributing in the first hour. The best way to learn is to teach, right? We follow the surgen approach by of see one, do one, teach one. We want you *doing* as soon as possible.

If you are writing software, we want to to be typing in the first hour.
If you are designing or writing, whatever the work, you are highly envolved as soon as possible.
