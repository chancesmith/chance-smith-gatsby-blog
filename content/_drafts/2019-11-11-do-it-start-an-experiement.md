Just start an experiment. <br/>
Try something new. <br/>
Sure, ask for permission. But who can say "No" to trying something once? <br/>
<br/>

## experiments to try

- archive all inboxed emails
- unsubscribe from all emails
- reduce your kids toys to 25%
- reduce dishes in kitchen to just enough for one meal
- limit focused work to 25mins, then take a break #pomodoro
- everyone goes headsdown for an hour right after lunch
-
