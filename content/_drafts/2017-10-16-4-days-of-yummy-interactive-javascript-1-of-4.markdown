Bring in Javascript to give your website/web-app a fun, helpful and usable experience. Let's talk about animation, content on-demand, and new ways to update users as they use your site or app.

## Day 1

Let's talk about animation. We'll animate text, new content, and user messages.



#1 - animate (text typing, enter/exit elements), modal, flash messages with toastr)
