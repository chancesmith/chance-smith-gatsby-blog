This morning I was thinking about the problems our client is wanting to solve:

1. Creating reliable and repeatable processes any team member can follow.
2. Build a team that can support the current work.

A light bulb went on in my head. We should share our Bus-coefficiency practice with you.

## Increase Bus-coefficiency

"How many team members can be hit by a bus and the project not fail?"

Any team member that can increase bus-coefficiency is invaluable. They understand that hoarding information helps no one. The dissemination of information is a key indicator of a great team player. For the ability that you can duplicate yourself, the more your organization can handle.

## Action steps you can take this week

Increase your Bus-coefficiency. Screencast or document frequent work that anyone else can do with some guidance.


This is a practice we have at [Sodium Halogen](https://sodiumhalogen.com?ref=csio).
