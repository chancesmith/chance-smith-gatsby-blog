This morning, I was thinking about the problems our client wants solved:

1. Creating reliable and repeatable processes any team member can follow.
2. Build a team that can support the current work.

A light bulb went on in my head. We should share our Bus-coefficiency practice with them.

## Increase Bus-coefficiency

"How many team members can be hit by a bus and the project not fail?"

Any team member that can increase bus-coefficiency is invaluable. They understand that hoarding information helps no one. 

The dissemination of information is a key indicator of a team player. For your ability to duplicate yourself, the more your organization can handle. Really, this is collaboration at is best.

## Action steps you can take this week

These are some ways you can dial up your collaborative efforts.

- **Record**: Screencast or document frequent work that anyone else can do with some guidance.
- **Decide together**: Include others in your decision making.
- **5on2**: Meet with a team member for 5mins to discuss any work that you’ll spend two or more hours on.


These are all practices we follow and teach at [Sodium Halogen](https://sodiumhalogen.com?ref=csio).
