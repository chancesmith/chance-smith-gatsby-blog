SOLID principles created by Uncle Bob. A guide for creating clean code.

I'm aiming for these to be approachable and applicable. Let's get to the point.

**S** - Single Responsibility
**O** - Open-Closed Principle
**L** - LisKov Subsition Principle
**I** - Interface Segregative Principle
**D** - Dependecy Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

"A class should only have one reason to change"

A object should be problem centered and responsible for one thing.

## Open-Closed Principle

"Create code, don't change it."

Extend your class to a more specific class.

## LisKov Substitution  Principle

## Interface Segregation Principle

## Dependecy Inversion Principle
