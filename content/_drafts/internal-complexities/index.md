I was reading a Peter Drucker book last week and gathered a new glossary term, [Surface Over Mass](/glossary/#surface-over-mass):

Prioritizing what impacts the customer and high-level metrics. Peter Drucker said to run lean. Organizations often focus on internal complexities over external impact. Think about a biological organism. The inner mass grows faster than the outer surface, which will divert energy to manage the internal mass.

The typical company stereotype holds true from what Blair Enns says in Pricing Creativity,
"Again, clients with in-house departments typically buy the higher-value and keep the busy work in-house."

I see this being systemic from companies being risk-averse.

A colleague suggested that a company should delegate aspects of the business and technology that have been commoditized.

> The more something goes to invisible to the user and commodity - stay away from that! In the cross hairs of this is basically everything we do for infrastructure, back-office processing, and then also things like user-sign in. While visible, they have become so commodity that they do not differentiate your business.

## The point is

Don't retain busy work.
Focus on real impact for our customers and longevity.
Prioritize the differentiators.
