## Week 1 -

You don't want to sacrifice all of your speed with the editor you know.

Add Vim to your current editor and only use the mouse when needed.
### Start with these commands

Get fluent in these commands for the first week.

- **hjkl** - up down left right
- **w** - jump foward by word
- **b** - back by work
- **y** - copy/yank
- **p** - paste
- **dd** - delete a line
- **u** - undo

## Change your workflow

- don't touch the mouse while editing code
- no more arrow keys
- hide your file tree and change files with your editor's shortcut key (vscode: CMD + P or CTRL + P)

## Conclusion

Vim is a powerful tool if you take the time to learn it.
