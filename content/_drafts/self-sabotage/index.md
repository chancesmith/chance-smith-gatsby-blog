Our second son loves to be funny. Bathroom jokes are a delight at the most undeisrable times. I've got a great appriatition for his humorous side, but the timing is challenging.

How much self-sabotage do we do to ourselves?

Bible says:
> Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. - [1 Peter 5:8-9](https://www.cgg.org/index.cfm/library/verses/id/1435/satan-as-lion-verses.htm)

The evil one is looking to distroy all the good things in our lives. Workout routines, relationships with your son or your wife. Everything.

Everytime I pass a homeless person, I think there must be a way that would impact their life.
What can I teach them that they can take and radically change their life?

There must be a grand amount of self-sabotage for everyone, including the homeless.

No more.

What is holding you back?
What crutches do you hold on to?

How are you focused on the now and instead of the future you?

Take 5 mins or 1 hour a day that makes you better for the future you. Just small progress to get you closer to where you want to be, closer to where you life would be ideal or a dream come true.

Pushups.
Running.
Reading a book.
Talking to a stranger.
