## Books read

This goal was a fail (learning experience). :P

I got stuck on "Bringing Up Boys" for the longest. Dr. Dobson has a ton of examples for parenting, but took such an emotional twol to read the book.

+ "Bringing Up Boys" by Dr. James Dobson
+ "10X Rule" by Grant Cardone
+ "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" by Marie Kondo
+ "The End of Jobs: Money, Meaning and Freedom Without the 9-to-5" by Taylor Pearson
+ "The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey" by Kenneth Blanchard
