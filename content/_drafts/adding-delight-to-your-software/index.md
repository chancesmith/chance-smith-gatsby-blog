Consider

## Store preferred settings for your user

Consider saving the states of your views or components based on what the user prefers.

- table column widths
- sidebar state of opened or closed, or draggable width
- search history

## Save user progress

We can assume the server is doing the right thing. Yet, we must also assume the user isn't done working and restore the user to their previous state. All progress is saved until the user has requested otherwise. Let's hold the user's progress until the server has returned successfully.

Just like a piece of paper, you expect the paper to still be in the same state you left it and all previous work intact.

## Give control to the user

- save preferred home screen
- saved table filter/sort-order

## Add multilingual by default

Be ready for the app to reach other countries.

## Add tooltips to provide context

On hover, explain what the icon button does. The HTML `title` attribute is the native tooltip, most easy to implement, and will bring some accessibility to your application.

## Add simple, but consistent animations

T

## Encourage exploration and familiarity

- subtle tutorial checklist (Evernote, but not forced)
- achievement based

## Add options for quick navigation

- tab order
- keyboard shortcuts
